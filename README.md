# SysEXY #
**Very much under construction**

Starting with a DSI Mopho synth, this library will allow two way communication with *specific* midi
hardware. There are already plenty of packages that allow any midi communication, so the goal here
is more one of simple configuration.

## Plan ##
API for sending sysex messages to specific hardware.

- provide mappings for different hardware
- provide simple configuration options for adding new hardware
    - both permanent additions to the module and one off configurations
- system dump
